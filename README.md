<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot](preview/preview.png)](https://example.com)


This project is a management system designed for me to keep track of general information about a book within an inventory space. It is meant for anyone who wishes to keep a track of the books they are looking for, purchased, or already collected. As a soon-to-be self published short read author, I would like to have inventory on a collection of my own books as well as others in my family and some I come across in life. I plan to build on this project even more and connect it to a database as well as my own indie author website.
